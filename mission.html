  <h1>Our Mission</h1>

  <p>
    Witness Tree Network exists to <strong>proclaim and embody the gospel of Jesus Christ</strong>
    through practical service to people in need. We allocate <em>at least 51 % of all income</em>
    directly to community outreach—partnering with local nonprofits, supporting teens,
    providing safe transitional housing, and more.
  </p>

  <p>
    We model our structure after historic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_Trees">witness trees</a>:
    a single, deep-rooted life giving rise to many living branches—our microchurches—each bearing fruit
    in its own unique context.
